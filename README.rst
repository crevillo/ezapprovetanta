eZApproveTanta is an extension for eZ Publish, adding the posibility of sending
mails whenever a collaboration item is commented, approved or rejected. 

Current eZ Publish functionality only sends e-mails when collaboration process
starts

How it works
-------------

It's heavily based on provided functionality by eZ Publish, but it adds..
- a workflow: just to add distinct identifier to the collaboration items created
- a custom collaboration handler: for adding notification events also when a collab
item is commented, approved or rejected
-
